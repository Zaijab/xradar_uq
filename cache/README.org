This directory contains files which are cached operations from intermediate code.
These are usually saved for operations which are somewhat expensive.

* "cache/true_state_1000.npy"

This is a shape (6,) array which is the result of 1000 time steps of CR3BP

* "cache/posterior_1000.npy"

* Code:

#+BEGIN_SRC
dynamical_system = CR3BP()
stochastic_filter = EnGMF()
measurement_system = Radar()


# TU: 0.242 is approx 1 Day
time_range = 0.242

# # How many measurements * time_range
measurement_time = 1000

for i in range(measurement_time):
    print(times_found, i)
    key, update_key, measurement_key, window_center_key = jax.random.split(key, 4)
    true_state = dynamical_system.flow(0.0, time_range, true_state)
    prior_ensemble = eqx.filter_vmap(dynamical_system.flow)(0.0, time_range, posterior_ensemble)
    predicted_state = jnp.mean(prior_ensemble, axis=0)
    
    if tracking_measurability(true_state, predicted_state):
        times_found += 1
        posterior_ensemble = stochastic_filter.update(update_key, prior_ensemble, measurement_system(true_state, measurement_key), measurement_system)
    else:
        posterior_ensemble = prior_ensemble
